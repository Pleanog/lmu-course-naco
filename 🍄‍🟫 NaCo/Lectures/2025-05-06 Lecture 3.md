### **Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA)**

In Elementary Cellular Automata, the next state of a **cell** depends on its **own state** and the state of its **left and right neighbors**.

Let the triplet be ¬†$(p,q,r)$ = (left, center, right).  
For **Rule 30**, the update rule is: Next $p \oplus (q \lor r)$

It is called **Rule 30** because its update pattern corresponds to the binary number `00011110‚ÇÇ = 30` in the decimal system.

### **Types of Behavior in ECA**

|Behavior|Description|
|---|---|
|**Uniformity**|The system evolves to a single, stable state everywhere (e.g., all 0s or all 1s).|
|**Repetition**|A small repeating structure emerges‚Äîlike a looped pattern.|
|**Random**|Appears chaotic, but is still fully deterministic.|
|**Complexity**|Looks random but is structured; large-scale order from simple rules.|

### **Outlook: Neural Cellular Automata**

A modern extension: **Neural Cellular Automata** use differentiable functions to update cell states.

**Example rule**
Here, the neighborhood $x_0$‚Äã to $x_8$‚Äã is passed to a function:

$$f(x_0; ..., x_8)=min\{255,2x_1+3x_4\}$$

This defines how a **neural cellular automaton (NCA)** updates a cell's state, based on its **local 3√ó3 neighborhood** (9 total cells: x0x_0x0‚Äã to x8x_8x8‚Äã). It's a **simple, differentiable update rule**, unlike traditional binary rules like Rule 30.

### **Context Comparison with Rule 30**

| Concept          | Traditional Rule 30                        | Neural CA (this function)                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update logic** | Binary rule based on (left, center, right) | Weighted sum of specific neighbors                          |
| **State**        | Binary (0 or 1)                            | Continuous (e.g., 0‚Äì255, like grayscale or signal strength) |
| **Neighborhood** | 3 cells                                    | 9 cells (3√ó3)                                               |
| **Example rule** | p‚äï(q‚à®r)p \oplus (q \lor r)p‚äï(q‚à®r)          | min‚Å°(255,2x1+3x4)\min(255, 2x_1 + 3x_4)min(255,2x1‚Äã+3x4‚Äã)   |
#####  **The Function**

- **Inputs $x_0, ..., x_8$‚Äã refer to the $3 \times 3$ neighborhood around a cell:
	$x_0 | x_1 | x_2$
	$x_3 | x_4 | x_5$
	$x_6 | x_7 | x_8$
- **Focus of the rule**: only two cells are used:
    - $x_1$‚Äã: the cell **above** the center
    - $x_4$‚Äã: the **center** cell itself
- **Calculation**:
    $\text{raw value} = 2 \cdot x_1 + 3 \cdot x_4$
- The **`min{255, ...}`** part ensures the output stays within a valid range (e.g., for grayscale pixel values or byte-sized states).

**Conclusion**
- This is a **differentiable**, soft update rule.
- The update depends **linearly** on specific neighbors (like a small neural net with fixed weights).
- This allows **smoother patterns** (0 to 255), **learnable dynamics**, and simulation of **natural processes** (e.g., morphogenesis).
